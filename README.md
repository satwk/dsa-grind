# LeetCode Solutions by Satwik 📊

Just me dumping all my LeetCode grind here.
This repo is a growing collection of my solutions, approaches, mistakes and everything in between.

# 📦 What's in here?

- My collection of LeetCode solutions, organised by category
- Explanations so I don't forget what I was thinking
- Time and space complexities — because brute force is only fun once
  
---

# 🤔 But why though? 

- To strengthen my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- To keep a clean, reviewable record of my coding journey
- To showcase **how** I think, not just that I solved it

Also, I like seeing green GitHub squares. It feels productive. Don't judge.
